This repository contains data & code to reproduce the results from our paper Breast cancer prevention by short-term inhibition of TGFβ signaling (Aleckovic, Cristea, Gil Del Alcazar et. al, Nature Communications 2022).

## Abstract
Cancer prevention has a profound impact on cancer-associated mortality and morbidity. We previously identified TGFβ signaling as a candidate regulator of mammary epithelial cells associated with breast cancer risk. Here, we show that short-term TGFBR inhibitor (TGFBRi) treatment of peripubertal ACI inbred and Sprague Dawley outbred rats induces lasting changes and prevents estrogen- and carcinogen-induced mammary tumors, respectively. We identify TGFBRi-responsive cell populations by single cell RNA-sequencing, including a unique epithelial subpopulation designated secretory basal cells (SBCs) with progenitor features. We detect SBCs in normal human breast tissues and find them to be associated with breast cancer risk. Interactome analysis identifies SBCs as the most interactive cell population and the main source of insulin-IGF signaling. Accordingly, inhibition of TGFBR and IGF1R decrease proliferation of organoid cultures. Our results reveal a critical role for TGFβ in regulating mammary epithelial cells relevant to breast cancer and serve as a proof-of-principle cancer prevention strategy.

## Preprocessed data
RDS preprocessed files, used either as input or as output of the scripts in this repository, can be downloaded from Zenodo here ... To run these scripts locally, download the .RDS data from Zenodo, and copy them to the _data/rdata_ directory. The scripts are reading/writing files to that path, reading in tables from the _tables/_ directory, and writing plots to the _plots/_ directory.
